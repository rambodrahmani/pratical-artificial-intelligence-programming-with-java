I wrote this book for both professional programmers and home hobbyists who already know how to program in Java and who want to learn practical AI programming and information processing techniques. I have tried to make this an enjoyable book to work through. In the style of a “cook book,” the chapters can be studied in any order. Most chapters follow the same pattern: a motivation for learning a technique, some theory for the technique, and a Java example program that you can experiment with. My Java example programs for this book can be found on github and can be used under both the LGPL3 and Apache 2 licenses - choose whichever of these two licenses that works best for you.

My goal is to teach you both the theory of common AI techniques and to provide you with Java source code to save you some time and effort. Because my example code is licensed under the LGPL you can use the code for any purposes including commercial applications. Your only responsibility for using my LGPL licensed code is that if you improve the code, you should make your changes to my example code public, preferably by sharing them with me so readers of future editions of this book can benefit from your improvements.

I have been interested in AI since reading Bertram Raphael’s excellent book Thinking Computer: Mind Inside Matter in the early 1980s. I have also had the good fortune to work on many interesting AI projects including the development of commercial expert system tools for the Xerox LISP machines and the Apple Macintosh, development of commercial neural network tools, application of natural language and expert systems technology, medical information systems, application of AI technologies to Nintendo and PC video games, and the application of AI technologies to the financial markets. I have also applied statistical natural language processing techniques to analyzing social media data from Twitter and Facebook.

I enjoy AI programming, and hopefully this enthusiasm will also infect you the reader.
